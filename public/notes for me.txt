user runs DSQ Enterprise.exe
it downloads launcher.exe after checking launcher.version and verifying version, and runs it.
launcher.exe runs main.js from local folder.
that runs index.html inside it.
inside the index.html window
  button submit mobility - runs subs.exe from local folder C/DSQ Enterprise/apps/subs.exe
  button updates - runs local c/DSQ..../updates/updater.exe


updater.exe:
  checks updates.txt from vercel server 
  the updater.exe then downloads those file names and overwrites on top of existing file where ever in subfolder or parent in c/DSQ Enterprise.

notes for updates.txt
  e.g : updates.txt contain: subs.exe>xyz.exe, main.js, deps.zip
  then updater will do the below:
  subs.exe>xyz.exe â†’ download subs.exe from Vercel, rename it to xyz.exe locally, and overwrite existing xyz.exe.
  Delete any old subs.exe locally if it exists.
  All files are downloaded first to a temp folder (C:/DSQ Enterprise/temp_updater/) to avoid collisions.
  After moving/replacing, the temp folder is deleted.

DSQ.py is python code of subs.exe
DSQ backup.py is older version of DSQ.py
deps.zip contains bundles folder.
